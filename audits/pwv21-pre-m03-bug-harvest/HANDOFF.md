# Sequential Bug Harvest Handoff


## Latest technical triage

- Batch in progress: `H019 + H020 + H021`
- Frozen batch candidate snapshot: `elmakus/project_workflow_v2@003f8a9a7c12a21d0c73b07163e449b8ae63bad8`
- H019 verdict: `CONFIRMED_MATERIAL`
- H019 current-candidate status: `persists`
- H019 evidence: `audits/pwv21-pre-m03-bug-harvest/evidence/H019.md`
- Next READY item: `H020`
- Current authorization continues with H020 then H021 only. H022 is not authorized by this batch.

## What was completed

The first-stage out-of-band workspace was initialized from the exact active-workstream HEAD captured before branch creation. Both persisted aggregate reports were normalized without performing a broad new product audit, without repairing product code, and without mutating canonical Project Workflow state.

All 27 PWv2 aggregate classes and all 4 M02R-T03 shadow aggregate classes were ingested. One clear semantic family was merged as **CROSS-SOURCE OVERLAP**: PWV2:C003 with M02R-T03:C02 (durable evidence locators accepted without proving the referenced artifact exists). This leaves 30 normalized harvest candidates. H001 through H019 have now been independently triaged and persisted. H019 is `confirmed_material` / `reproduced` / `pending_repair`. H020 and H021 remain authorized and READY; H022+ remain untouched by this batch.

## Exact durable workspace state

- Repository: `elmakus/chatgpt-codex-project-workflow`
- Workspace branch: `audit/pwv21-pre-m03-bug-harvest`
- Exact branch base: `598ac506012aa22c9b126ecf23dc01fa23598d64`
- Write boundary: `audits/pwv21-pre-m03-bug-harvest/` only
- Active product workstream branch remains read-only: `work/pwv21-policy-kernel-brainstorming`
- Canonical workflow state mutation: forbidden
- Product repair in this workspace: forbidden
- Stage: `source_normalization`
- Stage complete: `false`
- The branch HEAD containing this file is the durable triage snapshot for the next sequential worker.

These immutable subjects are different and must not be conflated.

## Candidate count

- PWv2 source classes ingested: 27
- M02R-T03 shadow classes ingested: 4
- Cross-source merged semantic families: 1
- Normalized harvest candidates: 30
- READY reproduction items: 11
- Completed reproduction items: 19
- First READY item: `H020`

## Next worker obligation

The next READY item is **H020**. Continue this authorized batch with H020, then H021. Do not process H022 or anything later.

The `003f8a9a7c12a21d0c73b07163e449b8ae63bad8` candidate SHA is the immutable snapshot for the entire H019+H020+H021 batch.

## Prohibited next-worker actions

- no canonical workflow mutation;
- no candidate product repair;
- no rewriting source audit reports;
- no skipping a candidate because it was found by only one reviewer;
- no mass verdicting without reproduction;
- no writes outside `audits/pwv21-pre-m03-bug-harvest/`;
- no writes to `work/pwv21-policy-kernel-brainstorming`.
