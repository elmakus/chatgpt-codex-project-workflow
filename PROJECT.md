# PROJECT

## Identity

- Project: `chatgpt-codex-project-workflow`
- Repository: `elmakus/chatgpt-codex-project-workflow`
- Lifecycle: `active`
- High-level goal: maintain and evolve the repository-backed Project Workflow contracts used by ChatGPT/Codex project execution.
- High-level status: Project Workflow Codex plugin Definition R2 accepts the verified `$pw:pw` bundled-Skill command; revised Master Plan `PWCP-P2` is pending independent review before M01 execution is reconciled and resumed.

## Execution policy

- execution_policy: `chatgpt_only`

Changing execution policy requires an explicit user decision.

## Context note

This file is a high-level router/policy/index, not live execution state.

The selected branch-isolated workstream is identified by `implementation/workstreams/feature-project-workflow-codex-plugin/WORKSTREAM.yaml`. Its canonical Task Board is active. M01-T01 remains execution-blocked while the Definition-R2-compatible `PWCP-P2` draft is independently reviewed; the current durable continuation boundary is `planning/reviews/PWCP-P2.md`.

Do not record current milestone/card, assigned executor, active branch/HEAD, checkpoint, current OpenSpec or blocker status here. Once implementation state exists, read the canonical Task Board selected by the active ChatGPT-only state context for mutable execution state.
