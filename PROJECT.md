# PROJECT

## Identity

- Project: `chatgpt-codex-project-workflow`
- Repository: `elmakus/chatgpt-codex-project-workflow`
- Lifecycle: `active`
- High-level goal: maintain and evolve the repository-backed Project Workflow contracts used by ChatGPT/Codex project execution.
- High-level status: Project Workflow Codex plugin M01 runtime verification found a current-Codex bundled-Skill naming constraint; execution is blocked pending one user/product Definition decision.

## Execution policy

- execution_policy: `chatgpt_only`

Changing execution policy requires an explicit user decision.

## Canonical authority pointers

- Active exploratory scope: `none`
- Active research obligation: `none`
- Requirements: `requirements/PROJECT_WORKFLOW_CODEX_PLUGIN.md`
- Approved plan: `planning/PROJECT_WORKFLOW_CODEX_PLUGIN_MASTER_PLAN.md`
- Current plan draft: `none`
- Current plan review: `planning/reviews/PWCP-P1.md`
- Open Definition question: `brainstorming/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md#pwcp-oq-001--explicit-codex-skill-entrypoint-under-bundled-skill-namespacing`
- Task Board: `implementation/workstreams/feature-project-workflow-codex-plugin/TASK_BOARD.yaml`
- Latest cumulative handoff: `project-handoffs/CUBC-M01_HANDOFF.md`
- Accepted decisions index / key pointers:
  - `decisions/ADR_PROJECT_WORKFLOW_CODEX_PLUGIN_PACKAGING.md`
  - `decisions/ADR_PROJECT_WORKFLOW_CODEX_PLUGIN_ACTIVATION.md`

## Context note

This file is a high-level router/policy/index, not live execution state.

The selected branch-isolated workstream is identified by `implementation/workstreams/feature-project-workflow-codex-plugin/WORKSTREAM.yaml`. Its canonical Task Board is active. M01-T01 is blocked on the Definition-owned explicit Skill naming question recorded in `brainstorming/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.

Do not record current milestone/card, assigned executor, active branch/HEAD, checkpoint, current OpenSpec or blocker status here. Once implementation state exists, read the canonical Task Board selected by the active ChatGPT-only state context for mutable execution state.
